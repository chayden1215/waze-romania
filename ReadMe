We are using Waze data to better understand mobility issues in Romania. The data comes from our data partnership with the World Bank. 
The data has the alerts as well as jams for three cities of interest.

See the notebooks for the packages needed to run the scripts. The data is cleaned in the cleandata script and will output a .csv file.
This script needs to be run before any other script can be run.
